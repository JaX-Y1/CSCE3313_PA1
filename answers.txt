---EXPLANATION: The limiting factor is the messages passing through the FIFO channel.
Basically each time you want to send a chunk to write, you have to send a request through the FIFI channel,
wait for a response, and then write in to storage. This synchronous process
results in a lot of overhead for larger file sizes, making it feel slow.
